# Temporal Behavioral Analysis Report

**University of Bath - MSc Computer Science Dissertation**  
**Student:** Muhammed Yavuzhan CANLI  
**Ethics Reference:** 10351-12382

## Executive Summary

This analysis addresses a critical gap in casino customer segmentation literature by introducing temporal behavioral patterns as enhancement features for traditional demographic analysis.

## Methodology

Temporal feature extraction performed on 1000 customers using:
- Weekend vs weekday preference analysis
- Late-night risk behavior assessment  
- Temporal consistency measurement
- Gaming time diversity analysis

K-means clustering applied to identify distinct temporal behavioral segments.

## Key Findings

### Temporal Behavior Clusters

**Cluster 0: Irregular Gaming Patterns**
- Size: 318 customers (31.8%)
- Weekend Preference: 0.582
- Late-Night Intensity: 0.029
- Temporal Consistency: 0.291

**Cluster 1: Irregular Gaming Patterns**
- Size: 212 customers (21.2%)
- Weekend Preference: 0.094
- Late-Night Intensity: 0.044
- Temporal Consistency: 0.261

**Cluster 2: Irregular Gaming Patterns**
- Size: 298 customers (29.8%)
- Weekend Preference: 0.444
- Late-Night Intensity: 0.028
- Temporal Consistency: 0.183

**Cluster 3: Irregular Gaming Patterns**
- Size: 172 customers (17.2%)
- Weekend Preference: 0.432
- Late-Night Intensity: 0.304
- Temporal Consistency: 0.507

## Academic Contributions

1. **Novel Feature Engineering**: First temporal behavioral features for physical casino analysis
2. **Clustering Validation**: Four distinct temporal behavior patterns identified
3. **Risk Assessment Integration**: Late-night patterns as responsible gambling indicators

## Conclusion

Temporal behavioral analysis provides valuable enhancement to casino customer segmentation, addressing a previously unexplored dimension in physical casino analytics literature.
