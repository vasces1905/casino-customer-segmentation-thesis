        This algorithm represents original research in detecting problematic gambling

        EDUCATIONAL EXPLANATION:
        Loss-chasing is a behavioral pattern where customers increase their bet
        amounts after experiencing losses, potentially indicating problematic

        ALGORITHM STEPS:
        1. Sort events chronologically
        2. Calculate net result for each event
        3. Identify loss events
        4. Check for bet increases following losses
