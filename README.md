## Abstract

This research implements machine learning techniques for customer segmentation and promotional response prediction in physical casino environments. Using anonymized historical data from Imperial Palace Hotel Casino (Bulgaria), we develop a novel framework that bridges synthetic proof-of-concept models with production-ready systems, ensuring both academic rigor and practical applicability.
