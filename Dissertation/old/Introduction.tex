\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
Casinos are complex entertainment ecosystems that rely heavily on customer retention and experience optimization to drive profitability. In physical casino environments, understanding player behaviour, preferences, and demographic segments is both a commercial imperative and a technological challenge. With the increased digitalization of gaming systems, the integration of AI into these environments has become feasible and necessary. Machine learning techniques now allow casinos to dynamically segment users, detect behavioural patterns, and generate data-driven promotional decisions in near-real time.

\section{Problem Statement}
While online casinos have long leveraged clickstream data and digital tracking, physical casinos often lag in adopting AI-powered personalization due to fragmented data sources, outdated infrastructure, and limited integration between operational systems like CRM, TITO (Ticket-In Ticket-Out), and slot logs. This creates a missed opportunity to deliver personalized promotions, identify high-value customers, and prevent churn. The lack of real-time, intelligent systems limits the effectiveness of marketing teams and fails to capitalize on available behavioural data.

\section{Overview and Scope}
This dissertation addresses the design and implementation of an intelligent promotional decision framework in a physical casino setting using machine learning. The system integrates heterogeneous data sources, including anonymized customer demographics, behavioural logs, and real-time session data. The technical focus lies on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning (K-Means) and predictive modelling via supervised learning (Random Forest). The framework is developed in a Docker-based Python environment with a PostgreSQL backend and follows academic standards in terms of ethics, reproducibility, and compliance (University of Bath Ref: 10351-12382).

\section{Key Concepts}
Key concepts discussed in this dissertation include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Customer Segmentation in Casinos
  \item Feature Engineering from Slot, CRM, and TITO Data
  \item Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering
  \item Supervised Learning: Random Forest for Promotional Decisioning
  \item Data Integration Architecture using PostgreSQL and Docker
\end{itemize}

\section{Aim and Contribution}
This project aims to deliver a reproducible machine learning pipeline that supports casino staff in making targeted promotional decisions based on real-time customer segments and behavioural indicators. The academic contribution lies in combining operational data with scalable AI techniques and delivering a GDPR-compliant, ethically governed system architecture.
