I confirm that this dissertation is my own original work and that I have complied with the University of Bath's academic integrity policies. 
In line with the GenAI “Type B” classification, I used Generative AI tools, specifically ChatGPT 4 (OpenAI, \url{https://chat.openai.com/}) and Claude (Anthropic, \url{https://claude.ai/}) to assist with:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clarifying technical concepts in machine learning and data pipelines,
  \item Improving grammar, structure, and language fluency in early drafts,
  \item Supporting the resolution of writer’s block during section planning,
  \item Debugging and developing Python code related to database querying, AI model training, and feature engineering.
\end{itemize}

All AI-assisted code has been reviewed, rewritten, documented, and adapted by me to fit the project’s academic and technical context. 
No code or text has been used verbatim without modification and comprehension, and no output was directly copied into this dissertation without verification.

Where appropriate, AI-generated ideas or summaries are treated as secondary sources in accordance with the University’s referencing policy. 
AI tools were not used to generate novel academic arguments or primary research analysis, and all final outputs reflect my own interpretation, decision-making, and academic judgement.
