\section{Background}

The casino industry has historically relied on intuition, manual observation, and rigid loyalty schemes to engage customers and drive revenue. However, with the increasing digitisation of casino infrastructure—including ticket-based transactions, smart slot machines, and customer loyalty tracking—new opportunities for data-driven decision-making have emerged. While online platforms have already benefited from machine learning and behavioural analytics, physical casinos have lagged in adopting similar technologies due to fragmented systems and operational constraints.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enabled more sophisticated analysis of customer behaviour, offering the potential to optimise promotional strategies based on real-time insights. In this context, the integration of machine learning into the operational backbone of a casino is not only feasible but necessary to remain competitive. By leveraging transactional, behavioural, and demographic data, casinos can transition from generic marketing to personalised, targeted promotions.

This dissertation explores such a transition by designing and implementing a machine learning-based decision support system tailored to the needs of a physical casino. The framework developed in this study aims to segment customers intelligently and provide actionable promotional insights that enhance both customer experience and business outcomes.
