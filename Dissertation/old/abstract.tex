The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for enhancing decision-making processes in physical casino environments. Unlike online platforms, traditional casinos face structural and technological challenges in integrating data sources such as slot logs, ticket-in ticket-out (TITO) systems, and customer relationship management (CRM) databases. This dissertation investigates the development of a machine learning-based framework to support promotional decision-making in a physical casino setting.

The proposed system adopts a hybrid data architecture and applies unsupervised learning through K-Means clustering to segment customers based on behavioural and demographic indicators. A Random Forest classifier is then employed to predict engagement levels with targeted promotions. The implementation is structured using a PostgreSQL database backend, Python-based AI modules, and a Docker-based deployment environment. All data is anonymised, ethically sourced, and processed in line with the University of Bath's ethics guidelines (Approval Ref: 10351-12382).

This work contributes a modular, reproducible, and scalable approach to customer analytics in the casino industry. The system allows casino IT staff to make informed, real-time decisions about promotion targeting, thereby improving operational efficiency and customer engagement without compromising data privacy.
